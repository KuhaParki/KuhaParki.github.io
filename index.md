## Welcome!

Welcome to my blog! Here I will be showcasing my talents on algorithms. I will be explaining the problems in detail and proposing solutions. This acts as my portfolio for my competence with algorithms.

## Shortly about me

I am a student of Computer Science and I find algorithms facinating. I like problem solving so it is all like a game for me. I wanted to build a portfolio of my skills and I thought that a blog of my work would be a great way to show my skills. I like algorithms because it is hard to vibe code it. I love understanding complex entities and I feel that AI is sometimes a barrier for learning. That is why I have posted references on every problem. I will do research with and without AI to show you my learning curve, not to just show a bunch of Chat GPT solved problems. AI is a great tool but more importantly, one has to truly understand the problems he is solving to find the best solution. Critical thinking is a must in algorithm engineering. 

I hope you enjoy the world of algorithms I am about to show you!
